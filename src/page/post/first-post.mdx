import { formatDate } from "../../utility";
import { Post } from "../../component";

export const parent = Post;

export const metadata = {
  title: "First blog post",
  subtitle: "In this blog post, you'll find out about some cool things you can do with Mesmer.",
  publishedOn: formatDate(new Date()),
  topic: "blogging",
  emoji: "waving-hand"
}

You can find this post in the `src/page/post` folder. Try running the Mesmer
dev server using `npm run dev`, modifying this blog post and see it being
rebuild on the fly!

To add new posts, simply add more MDX documents into the `src/page/post`
folder. And don't forget to annotate them with metadata. A metadata annotation
in MDX post can look like this:

```javascript
export const metadata = {
  title: "Another blog post",
  subtitle: "This is yet another blog post.",
  publishedOn: "12 Apr, 2022",
  topic: "blogging",
  emoji: "waving-hand"
}
```

Oh, and did I tell you about the cool code highlighting? The code is
highlighted using [Prism][1], but you can swap it for any other highligting
library of your liking.

For more info, check out the Mesmer docs.
